Advantages of exceptions;

1. Dinstingushing Error-Handling Code from "Regular" Code due to the maintenance: Exceptions proovide the means to separate the details of what to do when something extraordinary happens from themain logic and contention of the code.

2. Promoting Errors in the Call Stack:The ability to propagate error reporting up the call stack of the methods is another known advantage of exception handling.

3. Making the necessary distinctions and types of Errors: Because all exceptions thrown within a program are objects, the grouping or categorizing of exceptiuons is a natural outcome of the class hierarchy.
